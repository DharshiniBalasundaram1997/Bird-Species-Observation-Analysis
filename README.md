# Bird-Species-Observation-Analysis

# Approach and Analysis Overview

This project focuses on the analysis of bird observation data across various administrative units and habitat types. The following outlines the approach, types of analysis performed, and insights gathered through data processing and visualization.

---

## 1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

- Handle missing data and standardize observational metrics.
- Filter relevant columns for analysis (e.g., species, environmental factors, temporal data).
- Consolidate data from forest and grassland units into comparable formats.

---

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Analyze species distribution across administrative units and habitat types.
- Study observation frequency by year, month, and season.
- Investigate relationships between environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity) and bird activity.

## 3. Types of Analysis â€“ Examples

### 3.1 Temporal Analysis

- **Seasonal Trends**: Analyze the `Date` and `Year` columns to detect seasonal or annual patterns in bird sightings.
- **Observation Time**: Study `Start_Time` and `End_Time` to determine if specific time windows correlate with higher bird activity.

### 3.2 Spatial Analysis

- **Location Insights**: Group data by `Location_Type` (e.g., Grassland) to identify biodiversity hotspots.
- **Plot-Level Analysis**: Compare observations across `Plot_Name` to identify plots with higher species activity.

### 3.3 Species Analysis

- **Diversity Metrics**: Count unique species (`Scientific_Name`) and analyze their distribution by location type.
- **Activity Patterns**: Use `Interval_Length` and `ID_Method` to examine common activity types (e.g., Singing).
- **Sex Ratio**: Analyze the `Sex` column to understand male-to-female ratios for various species.

### 3.4 Environmental Conditions

- **Weather Correlation**: Explore the impact of `Temperature`, `Humidity`, `Sky`, and `Wind` on bird observations.
- **Disturbance Effect**: Assess how different `Disturbance` levels (e.g., slight effect) influence bird sightings.

### 3.5 Distance and Behavior

- **Distance Analysis**: Evaluate the `Distance` column to identify which species are observed closer or farther from the observer.
- **Flyover Frequency**: Examine `Flyover_Observed` trends to understand behavioral patterns.

### 3.6 Observer Trends

- **Observer Bias**: Analyze data by `Observer` to identify any patterns in species reported by individuals.
- **Visit Patterns**: Use the `Visit` column to assess how repeated visits impact species count and diversity.

### 3.7 Conservation Insights

- **Watchlist Trends**: Analyze `PIF_Watchlist_Status` and `Regional_Stewardship_Status` to track at-risk species.
- **AOU Code Patterns**: Study the distribution of species by `AOU_Code` to align with conservation priorities.

## 4. Visualization

- Interactive visualizations using **Plotly** in **Streamlit** or **Power BI**.
- Dynamic scatter plots and bar charts for species distributions.
- Temporal heatmaps showing year-wise and month-wise trends.
- Geographic mapping (if location data available) to highlight activity zones.
- Species- and environment-specific filters for exploratory analysis.

---

## 5. Additional Insights

- Identify high-activity regions and peak seasons for various bird species.
- Understand environmental influence on bird behavior and activity.
- Highlight conservation priorities and at-risk species for focused action.

This structured approach helps derive actionable insights from complex ecological data, supporting both scientific understanding and conservation efforts.
